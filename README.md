# pleasure-o-meter ðŸ˜Š
A simple UI rendered on real-time data, made with vanilla JavaScript (with the exception of [Pusher's JavaScript client](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js)).

### Installation and Use

First, clone the repo and navigate to the correct directory:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:nazwhale/pleasure-o-meter.git
$ cd pleasure-o-meter
```

Then, open `index.html` to see the pleasure-ometer in action.

### Approach

Got Pusher's event listener working, logging data to the console.
Then, binded that data to HTML elements.
Rendered emojis based on scores, instead of the scores themselves.
